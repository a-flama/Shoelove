# Shoelove

New project. 

Here's the idea. A IOS app that is used for negotiating shoes. Using a calculator and rememmber what each shoe costs is hard. Let's make it easier.

Overall Goals we wish to accomplish..
1. User friendly design, which is easy and quick.
2. A secure login database for saved negotiations and possibly subscription pricing
3. An api which allow for active shoe comparision with stockX (a online market for shoes and apparel)

Day 2 -> 1/23/25

Currently our organizing our final thoughts on what we wish to do with the app and what we can use to achieve our goals, as well as ensuring the security by seeing what steps in the sdlc we can take.

Researching things like how to use an API with StockX as well as a possible barcode scanner for instant shoe type retrieval. 
Also looking into possibilities of potentially expanding to ebay markets to find real time pricing of those who wish to simplify their resale game.

Day 3 -> 1/26/25
From what I understand, IOS is a pretty secure OS but there are several things that need to be addressed especially when developing an application. 
I got a better understanding from this blog post(god bless medium, so much good info on this site):

as well as:

We are going to hover on this for a couple days and identify what's unique to our app's development.
