# Shoelove

New project. 

Here's the idea. A IOS app that is used for negotiating shoes. Using a calculator and rememmber what each shoe costs is hard. Let's make it easier.

Goals we wish to accomplish..
1. User friendly design, which is easy and quick.
2. A secure login database for saved negotiations and possibly subscription pricing
3. An api which allow for active shoe comparision with stockX (a online market for shoes and apparel)
